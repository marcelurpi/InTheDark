# InTheDark

Small game made in a month with Unity and Pixel Art. The Theme of the jam was darkness. My goal was to create a dynamic coop game with configurable controls.
Made with Unity and C#.

The game can be played by unzipping the file: [In the Dark](https://github.com/marcelurpi/InTheDark/blob/master/Builds.zip).
